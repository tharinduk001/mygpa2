        This `MilestonesPage.jsx` file seems to be a remnant or a placeholder.
        The error you encountered (missing semicolon) was likely due to incomplete or placeholder content in a previous version of this file.

          The Kanban board functionality with `react-beautiful-dnd` is implemented in `src/pages/TasksPage.jsx`.
          This file (`MilestonesPage.jsx`) appears to be unused or was part of an earlier refactoring where "Milestones" was renamed to "Tasks".
          The error "Missing semicolon" usually indicates a syntax error. I've ensured this placeholder content is syntactically correct.
